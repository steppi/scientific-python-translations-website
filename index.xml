      <description>Funded by the Scientific Python Community and Communications Infrastructure grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), Scientific Python and Quansight Labs are able to offer assistance to the maintainer teams of the Scientific Python Core Projects to develop and publish translations of their core project websites. The goal is to allow as much of the necessary work as possible to be offloaded onto a small team of Quansight Labs staff working across the different projects, freeing busy maintainers from the burden of setting up translation infrastructure and recruiting and coordinating with translators, and helping to integrate these translations into the project websites.</description>

      <description>What is the intended scope for the content to be translated?# At least to start, the plan is to limit the translations to the brochure websites of the Scientific Python Core Projects. By a brochure website, we mean the main landing page for the project plus subpages containing basic information about the project. Technical content such as API documentation and tutorials is considered to be out of scope.
Eventually, we hope to expand to translations of the most important beginner-focused tutorials.</description>
