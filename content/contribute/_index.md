If you'd like to help out with the effort to translate the web pages of the Scientific Python core projects, feel free to email y at y@example.com with *scientific python translations* in the subject line or make a post in the **#translations** channel on the [Scientific Python Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/vur45CbwMz). Languages with a large population of speakers with no to low English proficiency will be priortized, but any language with enthusiastic translators who are committed to keeping translations up to date may be considered.

Potential translators who pass a vetting process will be given invitations to the Scientific Python Crowdin organization and on-boarded into the translation workflow.

There are several ways contributors can help:

* Make translations of web site content.
* Proofread existing translations.
* Make glossaries of technical terms.
